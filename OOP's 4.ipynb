Now there may arise a situation when due to some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also hides the data.

In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class.

Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able to be called into this function. Next, let’s give the function something to do that uses the ‘obj’ object we passed to it. In this case, let’s call the three methods, viz., capital(), language() and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’. Next, let’s create instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already. With those, we can call their action using the same func() function: "

    "For the grouping of two or more classes. Suppose we have two classes remote and battery. Every remote needs a battery but a battery without a remote won’t be used. So, we make the Battery an inner class to the Remote. It helps us to save code. With the help of the inner class or nested class, we can hide the inner class from the outside world. Hence, Hiding the code is another good feature of the inner class. By using the inner class, we can easily understand the classes because the classes are closely related. We do not need to search for classes in the whole code, they all are almost together. Though inner or nested classes are not used widely in Python it will be a better feature to implement code because it is straightforward to organize when we use inner class or nested class."
